                <h1>About Franklin &amp; Bash</h1>
                <p>When they're not hanging out at their favorite hot dog stand
                    pontificating on what they'd go through to enjoy a night with their
                    favorite female celebrities, Jared Franklin (Breckin Meyer) and
                    Peter Bash (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) are chasing down their latest
                    clients...sometimes literally. With business cards in hand, they're
                    ready to nab a client within seconds after a car accident, arrest
                    for solicitation or any other incident where their legal services
                    may be needed. Once in the courtroom, they show their flair for the
                    dramatic and the shocking.</p>
                <p>Peter has a knack for connecting with jury and judge, while
                    Jared loves sticking it to authority every chance he gets. Despite
                    their bad-boy antics, brash presentation and devil-may-care
                    attitudes, Jared and Peter are good lawyers who are willing to do
                    anything for a client, no matter who the client might be. That
                    quality catches the attention of Stanton Infeld (Malcolm McDowell),
                    a Renaissance man and the patriarch of Infeld Daniels, one of the
                    top law firms in Los Angeles. He sees a lot of himself in the young
                    men and decides to recruit the pair to bring a fresh energy to the
                    firm. Jared and Peter are joined by their two legal aides, the
                    brilliant, brassy Carmen (Dana Davis) and the agoraphobic,
                    verminophobic Pindar (Kumail Nanjiani).</p>
                <p>Infeld's decision to take on fresh talent doesn't sit well
                    with his nephew, Damien Karp (Reed Diamond), a lawyer who has his
                    own plans for the firm and a particularly shifty way of doing
                    business. The arrival of Jared and Peter also threatens Karp's
                    romantic - albeit celibate - relationship with Hanna Linden
                    (Garcelle Beauvais), a lawyer who takes an immediate liking to
                    Jared.</p>

                <p>In their new digs at Infeld Daniels, Jared and Peter handle a
                    variety of clients, from a woman fired for being too beautiful to a
                    family feud over a cherished baseball. But their story is really
                    about the incredible friendship they've built and how their
                    relationship is challenged now that they find themselves working in
                    a more corporate atmosphere. Only time will tell if these devoted
                    buddies can survive in this new environment.</p>
