//The task: allow the user to input weather forecast information, then create a graphic display of the forecast.

//when the user clicks "Generate graphics",
//create a weather forecast on the "canvas" element,
//showing weather information of each day
//The implementation is up to you.
// You may use image icons for cloudiness and wind directions,
// you may use colors for temperatures,
// you may draw trend lines for temperature changes, ...

//Before drawing anything, check if the inputs are appropriate:
// TODO - temperatures should be numeric values (both positive and negative, but the value is somewhat limited between -50 and 50deg C)
// TODO - wind speed should not be negative, but can be zero
// TODO - cloudiness value should be picked

//Bonus task: calculate the "weather feels like" value.
