1st homework

Exercise: 
Create a currency conversion tool using the given code mock-up (click to download mock-up). 
Currency rates have to be loaded from the Bank of Latvia (www.bank.lv) or European Central bank (www.ecb.info) web sites. 

The attached script is a mock-up of final code. It separates business logic from presentation:
- main logic (accessing currency rate file, conversion, preparation of output data) should be carried out in index.php
- view.php is loaded as the last instruction of index.php
- presenation logic (HTML code + little analysis of variable values and output code) should happen in "view.php"

Main tasks that have to be accomplished

- analyze user input data, perform currency conversion only if all mandatory fields are filled and data corresponds to expected type (e.g. amount can be recognized as a decimal value)

- parse the currency rate document in order to find the needed currency
- do conversion and round the result to 2 decimals

The variables that can be passed from index.php into view.php, are:
- $result_status (empty string, "success", "error): show on screen in if non-empty
- $result_message (a string to be displayed to the user - either error message or success explanation)
- $target_currencies (list of popular currencies, you can implement dynamic filling of this array) 

Additional information


The ECB currency rates can be found here: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml (remember, amount has to be divided by the rate to get the euro value). A good demo can be seen here: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html#dev 

The Bank of Latvia rates can be found here: http://www.bank.lv/vk/xml.xml (the amount has to be multiplied  with the rate)

For downloading the currency rates, you can use the file_get_contents or simplexml_load_file functions in PHP (if this does not work, check the "allow_url_fopen" switch in php.ini file).

The simplest XML data extractor is SimpleXML library, available in standard PHP bundle.  However, you need to know some XPath (see here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms256086.aspx)

 

Additional assignments for the i-option / grade 10.

To get the maximum score, include an option to convert the amount into Troy ounces (of gold). Gold exchange rate can be downloaded from http://www.goldfixing.com/today'sprices.htm where the data is available at this URL: http://www.goldfixing.com/vars/goldfixing.vars

Students who submit their work by the end of Thursday, September 26, get an extra point for that.

- what about lvl to lvl, eur to eur?
- currency units?
